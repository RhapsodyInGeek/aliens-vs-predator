Repository for various Aliens vs. Predator mapping and modding work.

Shape Rifs Reference is a catalog of all the various non-level object meshes. While the vast majority in the reference catalog are the official ones that came with the game and official tools, I plan on cataloging custom shape rifs and providing links to their downloads. Making this a community project allows others in the AVP modding community to contribute as well.

This catalog is written entirely in HTML and CSS but is intended as an offline reference. I don't really feel like setting it up for online viewing at this time, but maybe in the future.

I'll additionally be putting my own custom shape rifs in this repository as well for easy access.
