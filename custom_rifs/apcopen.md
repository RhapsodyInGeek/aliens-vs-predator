A couple maps have modules with open APCs. The APCs were "fused" in a manner of speaking to the modules they inhabited, making them a part of the level geometry.

I took the liberty of pulling the ACP module from the Invasion.rif map by copying the map and then removing every other module, object, spawner, light, sound... everything but the APC.

I then ended up having to retexture it, because I wanted to put the required APC textures into a separate folder to make it easier for mappers to add the required textures to their map RIFs. AVP is a very particular game to map for.

What's left is a fully collidable APC with an open traversable interior. I suppose you could technically put it on a track as well to make it roll, but my intention was to create starting points for players, or even just weapon pickup points. You could make it a spooky environmental storytelling set piece in your map if you want. Where'd the crew go? Possibilities aren't endless, but there's a lot!

Hope this helps make adding APCs to your maps easier!
